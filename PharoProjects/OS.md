This page describes basic interactions with the OS. The code snippet below should be working on all OS and are built-in: you do not need to install an external project to use them.

- [Execute shell command](#execute-shell-command)
- [Write environment variable](#write-environment-variable)
- [Read environment variable](#read-environment-variable)
